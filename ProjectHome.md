Portal Properties Manager for Liferay 6.1

This plugin allows you to

1) manage the properties that reside on an external file .properties 2) use these key / value as variables and pilot test within the various plugin Liferay through its config class with static methods called ad-hoc. (Example Config.getProp ("key"))

It 'a very useful utility if you have several virtual machine (development, test, demo, production) with the same Liferay Portal. The difference would lie on the portal externally defined property file on each machine.
